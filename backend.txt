1. What Will the Backend Do?
Here are some common features you might want to support:
Store and serve quotes (instead of/in addition to localStorage)
User authentication (login/signup, admin/user roles)
Handle favorites, feedback, and user-submitted quotes
Moderate quotes and feedback (admin panel)
Serve static files (your current HTML/CSS/JS)

2. Recommended Stack
Node.js with Express (simple, popular, and easy to connect to your current frontend)
MongoDB (for storing quotes, users, feedback, etc. — can use another DB if you prefer)
JWT for authentication (optional, but recommended for user/admin login)
dotenv for config
